  Introduction
</h3>

        <p>
            Within the lecture we were given an introduction on what the unit is about. We found out about our lecturers, Dr Rich Boakes our unit coordinator, Dr Jacek Kopecký, Dr Matthew Dennis, Dr Nick Savage and Dr Penny Hart. Within the lecture we were told that
            4 areas will be covered within the unit. These are: context awareness, academic skills, craftsmanship and technology skills.

        </p>

        <p>
            Firstly, context awareness is split into two sections which are, information and standards. Information consists of design, architecture and security. Standards consists of the technical side of coding and the best practice while the professional side
            deals with the ethical and moral practices.
        </p>

        <p>
            Secondly, Academic skills are another focus of this unit in which we will learn how to perform good research as well as good writing both of which will be essential for our literature review. The next focus was craftmanship which stated the tools, techniques
            and environments we will be using.
        </p>

        <p>
            Lastly, we were told about the code we will be writing in this unit. We were told about HTML and CSS and how content and form must be separated. Also, we were told about using media such as images and programming for both client side and server side.
            We were also told how the unit would be broken up. The unit is in 3 parts with the literature review weighing 30%, the website weighing 20% and the computer based test weighing 50%.
        </p>

        <p>
            Within the practical we were told to create and start our discovery log. Also, we started working on our virtual machine which is where our website will be uploaded to. We were tasked with setting up the virtual machine and to start the server up. Next,
            we were told to read over the coursework so we understand what is expected from us for both the literature review and the website. The next task was to complete the website awards form.
        </p>

        <p>
            Task 4 was to choose an editor however this is an ongoing task as this is for completing our website and will take numerous hours and multiple editors before it is completed. Currently I am trying out Notepad++
        </p>

        <p>
            The last task, task 5 was for us to expand our knowledge through further reading so we can gain a better understanding of the topic. We were given the opening chapter of Information Security Management Principles to read for next week's lecture.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Web Security
</h3>

        <p>
            Dr. Nick Savage led both lectures on web security. The first lecture was about Information & Social Engineering and the second was about Information & Technical Exposure. The first lecture started off with talking about the three main areas of web security
            which are: Confidentiality - Are you able to keep the information private, Availability - Who can access the information, Integrity - Is the information correct. The lecture then went on about how this would be applied to me and we went through
            what web security can lead to as well as analysing scenarios in which web security has been compromised. The lecture then ended on the various types of social engineering methods people use in order to gain access to sensitive information
            such as shoulder surfing and dumpster diving.
        </p>

        <p>
            The second lecture, Information & Technical Exposure started off with how large companies have been victims to malicious attacks that have resulted in information being exposed such as the code spaces incident that resulted in sensitive data being stolen
            and deleted from their servers due to a DDOS attack. We then proceeded to watch a youtube video where we had to point out any vulnerabilities that were happening in the system. We were then showed a number of link that talked about cyber security
            as well as data protection.
        </p>

        <p>
            Within the practical sessions we were told to get into groups in which we had to create a list about all the different types of information we generate on a day by day basis and we had to state how this information could be captured. This is the list
            my group and I created:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Location - Maps, GPS</li>
            <li>Workplace and home - GPS</li>
            <li>Transport methods and timings - Cookies</li>
            <li>Eating habits - Loyalty cards</li>
            <li>Sleeping pattern - Health monitoring apps</li>
            <li>Social groups - Social media (Facebook)</li>
            <li>Music - Streaming services (Spotify)</li>
            <li>News (Personalised topics) - Articles read</li>
            <li>Suggested films and tv shows - Previous movies watched</li>
            <li>Heart rate - Sensor in smartphone/watch</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>
  Reviewing Literature
</h3>

        <p>
            Our next lecture was about the literature review itself and what we are expected to do when it come to creating a literature review as well as how to research effectively. Throughout the lecture the idea that this is a literature review and not a literary
            review was hammered into our minds to make sure we would be creating the correct piece of writing. We were told that a literature review consists of :
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>What has been done before</li>
            <li>Major concepts, relationships & patterns</li>
            <li>Strengths, weaknesses, conflicts and gaps in research</li>
            <li>Approaches to a topic</li>
            <li>The context of future work</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            We were also warned about common mistakes students make such as incorrect referencing and using too many quotes.
        </p>

        <p>
            When it came to doing actual research we were given a place to start. We were shown that the best material to read would be papers in academic journals therefore, we should focus on journal articles. The university’s library was displayed as a great resource
            to use in order to find reliable journal articles and other materials. When looking at a source material we should consider how well of a source it is by checking if it meets these requirements:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Appears in a refereed journal</li>
            <li>Refers to other good sources</li>
            <li>May be written by a known/respected author</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Within the lecture we were given the website, coggle. The site make it easy to create a mind map as well as plan the structure of the document.
        </p>

        <p>
            Within our practical session we were tasked to create notes and start researching around the topic of risk mitigation. We were to start with search terms and then expand on those and then start taking notes on the materials found in order to find out
            the core themes around this topic. To find these search terms and materials I used both google scholar as well as the university library website. After we had done this once we were to continue to do it and refine our search terms and notes
            we created.
        </p>

        <h3>
  Academic Writing
</h3>

        <p>
            The academic writing lecture was about how to write well. The first part of the lecture focused on voices of different media depending on the audience such as a text message being very informal and the lack of grammar or punctuation. We also saw an example
            of an NHS flu jab poster which focused on being formal, informative, helpful and clear. Next, we were told our target audience was an established audience with an expectation on how the literature review should be written. These expectations
            were:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Evidence based</li>
            <li>Evaluative</li>
            <li>Thoughtful</li>
            <li>Structured</li>
            <li>Logical</li>
            <li>Neutral</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The next part of the lecture focused on editing our writing after we’ve written a final draft. We are to edit our work to make sure doesn’t include large sections of text without paragraphs or punctuation, ideas which jump around and ideas that have been
            discussed for far too long.
        </p>

        <p>
            After editing, the lecturers talked about referencing and how we should reference each source we use. We are expected to use the APAv6 format for our referencing. To help with referencing we are to use the library referencing tool
        </p>

        <p>
            Lastly we were shown the mark scheme which showed us clearly how we will be marked for our literature review.
        </p>

        <p>
            Within the practical session I completed the worksheet given to us which required us to in which we learnt how to improve our writing. I improved my writing by replacing contractions with full words, avoiding personal and subjective writing and using
            formal words within my writing. Lastly within the practical, I practiced the entire worksheet.
        </p>

        <h3>
  Reading Week
</h3>

        <p>
            During reading week there were no lectures running so I spent my time working on my literature review.
        </p>

        <h3>
  Introduction to Markup
</h3>

        <p>
            After handing in our literature review we started learning HTML within this lecture. I learnt that the web is mainly about communication. Within the lecture we were shown how we can manipulate simple text to make it show images as shown with the Darth
            Vader being created with text. We were then shown some simple markup commands such as striking through being ‘~~’ and bold being ‘**’. I also learnt that in HTML
            <p> tag refers to the paragraph tag and anything with the ‘
                <>’ are keywords.
            </p>

            <p>
                The next part of the lecture was about web addresses. At this point, i learnt that uniform resource identifiers(URIs) are web addresses and it consists of a scheme, domain, path, query and fragment.
            </p>

            <p>
                Within our practical session we were first tasked with creating a web page in which we had to include the doctype, title, h1 and p tags.After this task we were then told to use our virtual machine to upload the webpage we had created onto our virtual
                machine through the use of WinSCP.
            </p>

            <h3>
  Separating Form and Content
</h3>

            <p>
                In this style lecture I learnt that the markup language should only be used for text that helps convey meaning while a stylesheet is used for telling the browser how to display the different sections of the markup. Markup can be separated into two groups,
                procedural and descriptive. Procedural tells the markup what to do, how to look but doesn’t specify why to do it. On the other hand, descriptive markup tells us what the markup means and not how to look or what to do. We are expected to
                use descriptive markup in order to separate style and content. Also, it allows for a different presentation to be set for the same content without needing to rewrite the code again and it enables machine processing. We can style our HTML
                outside of the actual HTML through the use of CSS.
            </p>

<p>
  Within the practical session I learnt how to create my own stylesheet which can be done through creating a .css file and then linking the css file to the HTML file by using the command in HTML <link rel="stylesheet" title="My Style" href="mystyle.css">
I also learnt about using class selectors and id selectors. Class selectors should be used for multiple elements that will be styled in a certain way while id selectors can be used to style a specific element in the HTML.
</p>

<h3>
  Addressing the Web
</h3>

<p>
  This lecture was about links and how to use them in HTML. I learnt that to navigate a website you use links in order to go to the next page. I learn the structure of a URL is the scheme, username,password, host, port, path, query and fragment.
The scheme refers to the format in which the request should be sent such as, https://
The hostname refer to ip addresses using DNS.
DNS is the global record of domains to ip addresses such as .com or .ac.uk
Ports allow for network services to be run such as HTTPS on port 443.
The username and password can be provided within a URL but it is discouraged as it is a security risk.
Query strings are allow for variables to be passed onto the web page such as name=bob.
Fragments allow for the screen to be scrolled to a certain area of the web page such as index.html#cake.
</p>

<p>
  I learnt how to create a URL in HTML. It is done through the use of the "a" tag in the format "a href = "url">Link Text/a". Also, The URL can be either relative or absolute and URLs that do not contain a scheme are assumed to be relative URLs.
</p>

<p>
  Within the practical I cemented my knowledge on links as we were tasked with creating absolute and relative links as well as targets and fragments. These links were placed in a HTML file and then uploaded to my VM where I was able to to traverse different pages and go to different websites.
</p>

<h3>
  Using Images
</h3>
<p>
  From the lecture and practical I learnt how to add images to a webpage. This is done through the use of an "img" tag and is used in this format "img src=”img/uop.png” alt = “A uni building” height =”400” width=”400”"
</p>

<p>
  I also learnt how to resize an image which is done through changing the height and width attributes but in order to keep the aspect ratio it is recommended only one attribute is changed.
Furthermore I learnt how to add a video into a webpage which can be done through the video tag.
</p>
