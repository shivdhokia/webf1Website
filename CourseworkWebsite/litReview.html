    Mitigating personal information exposure on the web

        <h3>
  Introduction
</h3>

        <p>
            The web contains a staggering amount of personal information due to our dependance on it. This has lead to many people with malicious intent wanting to obtain this personal information without the user’s consent as a result, it is beneficial for the user
            that there are security measures in place to stop the exposure of their personal information on the web. This literature review explores some of the methods used, specifically the use of strong passwords, informing users on avoiding phishing
            attempts and anti-virus software.
        </p>

        <h3>
  Passwords
</h3>

        <p>
            One of the most vulnerable parts of a system is the user. The user is a potential route that an unauthorised person can use to gain access to a system. This can occur due to weak passwords set up by users for their accounts on the web that house personal
            information. In a recent study, users were likely to create numerical passwords as 45.01% of passwords within the study consisted solely of numbers (Shen, Yu, Xu, Yang & Guan, 2016, p.139). In order to stop the user’s personal information
            from being compromised they should consider increasing the length of their passwords, increasing the character set used and avoiding predictable and common words as these factors will increase the time needed to crack a password(Chanda, 2016,
            p.28). This method of mitigation is successful as it increases the time needed to crack the user’s password by increasing the number of possibilities that the password could be when performing a brute force attack and decreases the chances
            of a successful dictionary attack on the user’s password. However, a possible limitation is that if the attacker is given enough time, they will be able to decode the password.
        </p>

        <p>
            Another method to frequently force the user to change passwords since it decreases the chances that a hacker will be able to find out the right password at a given time(Klein, 1990, p.8). By the user changing their password will mean that an attacker
            will have a shorter time to crack the password until they need to restart since the user has completely changed their password. However, if user were not to change their password to a completely new one but instead keep a set of passwords
            on rotation they would put their information at risk.
        </p>

        <h3>
    Phishing
  </h3>

        <p>
            Further danger is directed towards the user since they can be manipulated into giving up personal information through phishing attacks. Phishing is a method to obtain personal information from a user by pretending to be a trustworthy organisation or person
            through the web. The user can avoid phishing websites through training sessions which require the user to identify which URLs lead to phishing websites in order to gain an understanding on how to detect and avoid phishing websites(Arachchilage
            & Love, 2014, p.310). In addition to phishing websites, the user must be able to avoid phishing emails which they can do by not opening emails that urgently require personal information from the user, not to fill out any forms within an email,
            especially from banks and not clicking on links within an email(Patel & Luo, 2007, p.3). These methods are successful in preventing phishing attacks as they teach the user how to spot common practices in phishing websites and emails resulting
            in the user not clicking on the URL or opening the email. However, a large limitation with this method is that the user must be able to implement their knowledge themselves and can not be helped by the system as a result the user is still
            susceptible to phishing attacks if they were to forget what was taught to them or simply not use it.
        </p>

        <h3>
      Viruses
    </h3>

        <p>
            Malware are a common method of attack on the user in order to gain their personal information.Viruses are a typical form of malware that infect a user’s system by being executed on a computer without the user being aware and are then able to perform malicious
            tasks. One method that has been proposed to stop a system from being infected is to focus on the emails of the users since this could be a means hosting the virus and spreading it across the network. By using targeted removal of vertices in
            a network in order of largest address book size as it can sharply decrease the number of viruses in the system while needing to only protect 10% of the entire system(Newman, Forrest and Balthrop, 2002, p.3). This form of mitigation is successful
            because the system is able to greatly reduce the number of viruses within the email network by only needing the focus on protecting 10% of the entire network. By doing this the virus is cut off from the rest of the network resulting in the
            entire network becoming safe from the threat since the targeted anti-virus software removes the virus from specific vertices therefore, personal information does not get accessed.
        </p>

        <h3>
      Conclusion
    </h3>

        <p>
            In conclusion, it is possible to mitigate personal exposure on the web through the use of strong passwords as it does result in more time to guess the user’s password also, the user changing their password makes it difficult for hacker to guess the right
            password used. By changing passwords on a regular basis it shortens time frame the hacker has to use obtain password before needing to restart. However, these are only effective methods at slowing down the process of obtaining passwords as
            they extend the time needed to crack a password. In order to avoid phishing attacks the user must be informed on common practices in phishing attacks this however, can be ineffective as the user can simply ignore any guidelines given and put
            themselves at risk on the web. Lastly, the use of targeted removal of vertices within a network allows for specific areas of a network to be targeted by the anti-virus rather than the entire network. This results in successful attempts to
            find and remove the virus.
